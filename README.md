### Identify candidates for part definition in BHL and track the required work

This repo will be used to track the definition of journal articles within the journals included in **Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL)**. It will also be used to track the definition of book chapters within books included in **BHL**. New BHL DOIs may be acquired or existing, non-BHL DOIs may be gathered and saved in BHL. A separate GitHub issue will be opened for each journal or book considered.

Project management in GitHub using issues will do the following:

* Allow a wide audience to 'nominate' journals and books for article and book chapter definition.
* For each journal or book, define the tasks that must be performed and track their completion
* Prevent duplication of effort by tracking the assignment of tasks to individual GitHub users
